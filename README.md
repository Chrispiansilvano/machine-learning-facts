some notes on machine learning

In 1950, Alan Turing a well-known computer scientist proposed a test known as 
Turing test in his famous paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” The test was 
designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence, which required 
that a human being should not be able to distinguish the machine from another human 
being by using the replies to questions put to both.

To be able to pass the Turing test, the computer should possess the following 
capabilities:

•	 Natural language processing, to be able to communicate 
successfully in a chosen language
•	 Knowledge representation, to store information provided 
before or during the interrogation that can help in finding 
information, making decisions, and planning. This is also 
known as ‘Expert System’
•	 Automated reasoning (speech), to use the stored knowledge map 
information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions 
where required
•	 Machine learning, to analyzing data to detect and extrapolate 
patters that will help adapt to new circumstances
•	 Computer vision to perceive objects or the analyzing of images to 
find features of the images
•	 Robotics devices that can manipulate and interact with its 
environment. That means to move the objects around based on 
the circumstance
•	 Planning, scheduling, and optimization, which means figuring 
ways to make decision plans or achieve specified goals, as well as 
analyzing the performance of the plans and designs
